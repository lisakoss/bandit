# INFO 343 - Final Project: BANDIT

This repoitory contains the completed code for a website named "Bandit". Bandit is a service designed to connect musicians to musicians to help them find their next gig, band, or collaboration breakthrough locally or worldwide. Users can post and search through job listings (whether they're looking for talent to join them or if they're offering up some skill of their own) while every band and artist has the ability to create a profile for themselves to showcase their abilities and experience. If someone likes what they see, they can instantly get into contact with them via direct email or by commenting on a particular listing. Bandit is a hub where talented musicians and bands can find what they're looking for. In order to use this site, you must sign up for an account.
